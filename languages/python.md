# Python

| Language Versioner | .zshrc Needed | Language Version | Alias Needed | Install & Build Tool |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Brew and .zshrc    | Yes           | Brew and Conda   | Yes          | Not sure             |

## Not Sure Yet

- List out what versions of Python are available

```bash
TODO
```

- List the current version of Python that is set for use
- This is set with an alias in the .zshrc file and Brew Python dependencies

```bash
python --version
```

- Update current Python version to latest i.e. Python released some patches

```bash
brew upgrade
```

- Install a different version of Python then the latest

```bash
brew install python@3.XX
```

Complete the below section afterwards

- Use an installed version of Python

```bash
openzshrc
```

Change the alias for pip and Python to point to the version you are wanting

```bash
sourcezshrc
```
